# letus

A command line binary, written in Clojure, aimed at increasing developer productivity. Manage bookmarks and more, without having to constantly switch applications and context.

Example:

```
letus config add quip,mappings rca=https://instacart.quip.com/dmIBAZkADIRn
letus quip rca
```

The link to your Quip doc for RCA items immediately opens in browser. No more wondering if you have it bookmarked in this or that browser, or starred in quip, or whatever.
